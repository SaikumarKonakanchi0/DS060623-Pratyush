# For Loop --> If we want to execute a group of statements from a sequnece 
# iteratively then we are using for loop.

# While loop ==> if we want to execute a group of statements 
# multiple times until a condition becomes false then
# we are going to use while loop.

# Syntax:

# while condition:
#     statement-1
#     statement-2
#     increment/decrement

#Print Hello World 5 Times
# i=0
# while i<5:
#     print("Hello World")
#     i=i+1

# Infinite Loop In Python:

# if we want to create infinite loop in python then in place of condition
# we can pass any constant values like 1,2,3,4,any string.etc except 
# except empty characters and contents.


# while 1:
#     print("Hello World")

# while "Edyoda":
#     print("Hello World")

# while True:
#     print("Hello World")


# Practice Problems:
